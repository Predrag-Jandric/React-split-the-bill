## About 👋

Split the bill is a React application designed to manage a list of friends, allowing users to add new friends, select friends, and split bills among them. This project demonstrates the use of React hooks and components to build a dynamic and interactive user interface.

Everything is stuffed in `App.js` on purpose as this was a practice project on how props flow, and lifting state.
